An effort of adding old chipsets support (primarly i855GM, since i have it) to AROS's IntelGMA driver. Someone requested this on AROS-Exec once, and offered to create payed bounty for this task on Power2People portal (although i find this unnecessary, since it's relatively easy task to do). I don't have time to finish this right now, but i promise, that i'll do eventually (unless someone 'll do this task before LOL), since machine (FS P7010) with this particular integrated graphics is still in my hands, and i strictly doubt that i will sell it ever. I find AROS (amongst MorphOS and AmigaOS, but these are close-sourced :-( ; Haiku OS is quite good too, but their codebase is too C++'ish) project very interesting and i also hope that it will stop today popular "pryshi" obsessive madness some day ;-)
By the way, if you wish to learn something about IntelGMA and haven't much free time to look through whole hw docs, look at OpenBSD intel console graphics driver at first, it shows simple BAR handling, initalizing and initial resource allocation and does it quite properly. For futher, take a look at Intel DRM code from Linux kernel written by Eric Anholt, it clears some important moments ;-)
