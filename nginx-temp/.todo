3. If SSL session reuse mechanism is activated (it's so, unless you explicitly set
'proxy_ssl_session_reuse' directive to off state; it's current purpose is only to force session
reusing for mail agents, which initiate multiple sessions, one by one, via single keepalive
connections), consider of incrementing NGX_MAIL_SSL_REUSE_POOL_SIZE preproc directive's value by
some to adjust your needs. It's in ngx_mail.h. Note that 'proxy_ssl_session_reuse' will not enable
actual session reuse mechanism: for that you just need to set SSL session cache via
'ssl_session_cache' directive, see docs for mail SSL module.
