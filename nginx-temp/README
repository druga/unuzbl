Written in hackish style, without styling, not for upstream tree for sure.
Done against nginx-1.0.11 code from OpenBSD CVS.
1. Allow hostnames in "Auth-Server" header. Useful, when auth_http mission rules by nginx itself
(i.e. no external script used, see http://vgimly.blogspot.com/2009/07/nginx.html for info). If host
has few IPs pointing to various mail servers, and some is/are down, the first answered server will
be used. If you're not running recursive DNS server at localhost, don't forget to set some via
'resolver' directive. This implementation is ready for chrooted installs.
2. Add possibility of secure connections to backends via "Auth-Protocol" header. Supported options
are 'ssl' and 'starttls'. Other, the special keyword 'secure' might be used, indicating that any
of two is acceptable: SSL is tried first, STARTTLS second; note that this is an expiremental
feature, and some mail servers will not deal with it.
