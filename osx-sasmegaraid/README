Attention! Not ready at all, nothing to show, pure shame...

I/O Kit driver for LSI MegaRAID SAS family of hardware RAID controllers. Loosely based on Marco aka marco@ Peereboom work at mfi(4) in terms of OpenBSD project. This driver is Xcode project, for Mac OS X, written in so-called Embedded C++ language (real crap), although some restrictions broken by me (C++ templates were used in purpose of portability - like some generic PCI-related stuff).
Note, that probably almost every card from this family requires x86 host to get access to device firmware (not related to driver, but you will not be able to do initial setup of things outside of OS, i.e. you'll need to insert card inside of PC to create virtual disks and so on...). Also most of devices haven't EFI-compatible firmware, so you'll have problem not only on PPC hosts, but on original Macs with EFI firmware too. The ideal box to play with is a Hackintosh setup (PC with BIOS).
